In this role, she sources, appraises, and catalogues all manner of printed books, literary manuscripts, and archives for auction and private sale.<br><br>\r\nIn her time at Christie's, Heather has contributed to a wide variety of auctions. She helped lead The Exceptional Literature Collection of Theodore B. Baum ($9,657,875, September 2021), which set a record for a printed work by a woman with the first edition of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein in original boards ($1,170,000). In addition to the Shelley, a personal favorite from the sale was a first edition of Jane Austen's Mansfield Park that had contemporary circulating library notes written on the covers. Heather also had the joy of cataloguing many books from The Herman Melville Collection of William S. Reese (September 2022), including a first edition of The Whale in original cloth (realizing $302,400) and Melville's own copy of Dante ($441,000).<br><br>\r\nHeather holds an A.B. in English from Vassar College, where she concentrated in Medieval and Renaissance Studies. She worked in the New York book trade while pursuing an M.L.S. from Pratt Institute with a certificate in Archives and a concentration in Special Collections. She is currently a member of the Grolier Club, where she serves on the Publications Committee.",
